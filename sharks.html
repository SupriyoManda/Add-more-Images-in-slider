     <p style="color: white; text-align: justify;font-size: 30px; margin-right: 80px ;">Sharks are a diverse group of fish. There are about 400 known species of sharks. sharks are also a very old group of fish. They have existed on earth for over 400 million years. shark sizes range from the size of a banana to larger than a bus. Most sharks actually avoid humans and only attack if they have not eaten in a long time. For example : great white sharks. Only a few species like bull sharks attack humans frequently. Sharks are closely related to other types of fish: rays and skates.</p></div></div>

     <p style="color: blue; text-align:justify;font-size: 30px;"> Sharks have 6 senses: sound, smell, touch, taste, sight, and elctricity. Sharks can sense the movement of a creature buried in the seabed using the electricity the movement produces using special smale holes on its snout called Ampullae of Lorenzini.</p>

     <p style="color: blue; text-align:justify;font-size: 30px;">Megalodon was a giant shark that lived 23 to 3.6 million years ago. It was approximately 46 to 67 fett long. It used to feed on whales. It was the largest shark that ever lived.</p></div>

      <p style="color: blue; text-align:justify;font-size: 30px;">Whale sharks are the largest sharks in the world. Their average length is 10 to 12 m. They are filter feeders, which means they seive out plankton from the ocean. A whale shark uses bristles in its gills to trap plankton. Scientists think whale sharks can live upto a 100 years. Whale sharks have pale stipes and spots all over their skin. Even though whale sharks are extremely large, they are harmless to human since they cannot swallow anything bigger than plankton and some small fish.  </p>

      <p style="color:blue; text-align: justify;font-size: 30px;">Thresher are sharks easily recognisable due to their incredibly long upper lobe of their tails. Including their tails, thresher sharks can grow to upto to 6m in length. Thresher sharks use their tails to round up shoals of fish such as sardines. They then stun the fish by beating them with their tails.There are 3 species of thresher sharks: Common threshers, Pelagic Threshers, And Bigeye Threshers. Common Threshers are the best known and are often found near the shore. Pelagic Threshers prefer to stay in the pelagic zone - the open sea, away from shore. Bigeye threshers often live deep down in the sea. thes threshers can have eyes up to 10 cm across.</p>

      <p style="color:blue; text-align:justify;font-size: 30px;">Due to their incredibly long flattened, pointed snouts, the goblin shark looks very scary. They can stick their jaws right out of their heads. The goblin shark's snout looks like a weapon, but scientists think that it uses the snout to find prey using electrical detection. Goblin sharks have pale pink skin that is softer and flabbier than that of other sharks. goblin sharks feed on fish, squid, and crustaceans. most goblin sharks grow to a size of 1 to 2 m. Goblin sharks are rarely caught, therefore not much is known about them.</p>

      <p style="color:blue; text-align:justify;font-size: 30px;">Greenland Shark is a sharks species that grows to 6.5 m in length. These sharks like cold water. They live around Greenland, Iceland, and Canada, and can stand temperatures as low as 2Â°C. Luminescant Copepods are tiny sea creatures that live in the shark's eyes and make them glow in the dark. Greenland sharks eat fish, squid, seals, and sealions. They also scavenge on the dead bodies of whales.</p>

    <img src = '/sharks/shark tooth.jpeg' width = '100%'>
      
     <p style="color: blue; text-align:justify;font-size: 30px;"> Since sharks have skeletons made of cartilage, they rarely make fossils. Sharks are dentified using teeth and fins which can be fossilized. Shark fossils are often found on land where the ground used to be under the sea millions of years ago.</p>
